# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3
Continuation of web stack debugging exercises.  
In this project, we were tasked with figuring out why a given wordpress   
website was not responding as expected.  
Using tmux and strace the problem was found and a puppet manifest, was  
written to address the situation.
